#**Bamazon App**
This is an example app of a marketplace where you can go to buy 10 versions of the once VERY popular Four Loco. It keeps track of the inventory, the total cost of the customers order and then reruns the app--just in case you didn't get enough Loco in your first order. Below is the link to the video of the app running. You can see it in all of it's glory.
